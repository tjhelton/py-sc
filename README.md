## 🛠️ Development

### Code Quality
This project uses automated linting and formatting tools. **All linting commands must be run from the `contribution_tools/` directory**:

```bash
cd contribution_tools/
make lint      # Check code quality
make fix       # Auto-fix formatting issues
make help      # See all available commands
```

### Pre-commit Hooks
Automatically format and lint code before commits:

```bash
cd contribution_tools/
make pre-commit
```

### GitHub Actions
- Automated code quality checks on all pull requests
- Linting and formatting validation
- Ensures consistent code standards

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** with pip
- **SafetyCulture API Token** - [Get yours here](https://developer.safetyculture.com/reference/getting-started)
- **API Access** - Appropriate permissions for your use case

## 🔧 Dependencies

Install all required dependencies for the scripts:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs:
- **pandas** - CSV data processing and manipulation
- **requests** - HTTP requests to SafetyCulture API
- **aiohttp** - Async HTTP requests (for concurrent processing scripts)

## 📖 Usage Patterns

### Standard Workflow
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Navigate to desired script directory
3. Set API token in `main.py` or environment variable
4. Prepare `input.csv` (if required)
5. Run `python main.py`
6. Check output files

### Authentication Methods
- **Token in script**: `TOKEN = 'your-token-here'` (most scripts)
- **Environment variable**: `export SC_API_TOKEN="your-token-here"` (advanced scripts)

## 📊 Input/Output Formats

### Standard Input
Most scripts expect `input.csv` with relevant IDs or parameters. See individual script READMEs for specific formats.

### Standard Output
- CSV files with processing results
- Timestamped output directories (for complex scripts)
- Terminal progress logging

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Security**: Never commit API tokens or sensitive data
- **Testing**: Always test with small datasets first
- **Irreversible**: Many operations (delete, archive) cannot be undone
- **Rate Limits**: Scripts include appropriate delays and retry logic
